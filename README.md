# cybertarot
This project is focused on the aesthetic/historical aspect of the cards. The idea is to get randomized readings in different spreads and access to symbolic data from each card.

Pretty much still WIP.

The dataset was obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lsind18/tarot-json
Fisher-Yates algorithm from: https://www.npmjs.com/package/knuth-shuffle
